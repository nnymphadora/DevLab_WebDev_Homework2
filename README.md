# DevLab_WebDev_Homework2

This project is my attempt at completing Developers Lab, WebDev 2022/23 course Homework 2. The project consists of HTML and CSS, and aims at showcasing my CSS skills so far. The project consists of 4 pages, all created on set guidelines and requirements.

The index.html and index.css files contain most of the HTML and CSS for the homepage. In addition to this, for quicker access styless.css contains the fonts, colors and layout (margin and padding) styles, as well as button designs and animations. Aside from this, the project uses fonts found on Google Fonts. Media queries can be found in styles/media-queries. Currently, only the mobile responsive query is finished
.

The project currently consists of two pages, home and about us. I plan to add one more.

The project is a recreation of the "Tech Product Home Page" design created by Ehsanul. You can find the design and more info on the author in the "design" folder. The .xd file can be opened through https://figpea.com/.

While the design itself contains some design guidelines for color and fonts, some are not clearly specified. In these instances, I tried to copy the visual appeance to the best of my ability.
