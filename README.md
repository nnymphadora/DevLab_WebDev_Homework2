# DevLab_WebDev_Homework2

This project is my attempt at completing Developers Lab, WebDev 2022/23 course Homework 2. The project is mostly HTML and CSS, with a dash JS. It aims to showcase  my CSS skills, so far. I created 3 media quries(mobile small, mobile medium and tablet), to make the design responsive. 

The project is a recreation of the "Tech Product Home Page" design created by Ehsanul. You can find the design and more info on the author in the "design" folder. The .xd file can be opened through https://figpea.com/.

While the design itself contains some design guidelines for color and fonts, some are not clearly specified. In these instances, I tried to copy the visual appeance to the best of my ability.
